Pub Title	Yaggy's Geographical Study Comprising Physical, Political, Geological, and Astronomical Geography. Published by Western Publishing House. Chicago. Copyrighted 1887.
Pub Note	Yaggy's large geographical charts are among the most beautiful and impressive educational charts published in the 19th century. Using chromolithography, Yaggy created stunning colors and contrasts in his images of the world, its regions, and peoples. Yaggy intended his charts to be used in classrooms by students, and issued a teacher’s handbook to assist with instruction. This set of 4 charts includes 2 charts with multiple states of viewing with flaps and rear illumination, 1 fixed chart of the climate zones, and 1 three dimensional topographic map of the United States. Yaggy published other educational works: Yaggy's 1893 Geographical Portfolio consisting of ten charts (see our 10096.000); Museum of Antiquity; A Description of Ancient Life… (1880); The Royal Path of Life; Or, Aims and Aids to Success and Happiness (1881); The Standard History of All Nations and Races… (1899); and How to Do a Consulting Library for Every Want (1902); Yaggy’s Anatomical Study; Presenting the Skeleton, Muscles, Arteries, Veins and Nerves, also Four Life-Size Manikins of the Body, the Head, the Eye and the Ear (Chicago, ca. 1884-1885), which featured life-size illustrations and cutaways of the human body.
