### Making the StoryMaps 

I've made two videos that introduce you to StoryMap.js -- one about the utility more generally, and one that focuses on how to create a StoryMap that uses a historical map.

If you don't want to watch a video, you can find an excellent written tutorial on how to host your tiled images on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/blob/master/GITHUB_HOSTING/GITHUB_HOSTING.md).
