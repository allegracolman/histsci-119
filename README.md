# HISTSCI 119VH: Digital Humanities Component

As part of this course, you will be using StoryMap.js to chart the movement of people, things, and ideas across the world. This tool will help you create an interactive map that you can then embed onto your own website, which will be hosted using GitHub Pages. (It is also possible to embed the StoryMap directly onto platforms like Medium. However, as we will discuss in class, we are asking you to learn how to host these projects using HTML, CSS, and GitHub so that you can have better control of your data, and so that it's easily maintainable.)

If you need **technical help**, you can attend the [Harvard Digital Scholarship Support Group (DSSG) office hours](<https://dssg.fas.harvard.edu/event/dssg-office-hours-f19-th/>) (if you can't make the office hours, they can assist you remotely or set up a separate appointment). You can also email Jeremy Guillette (jguillette@fas.harvard.edu), the academic technologist for FAS, for additional help. 

To discuss the **conceptual components** of your project (especially before you are due to present in class), you can book office hours with the course teaching fellow, Crystal, [here](https://crystallee.youcanbook.me/). 

## Instructions

### Accounts and applications you'll need

Before you get started with making your StoryMaps, please make sure that you have the following: 

1. You will need a personal or a [Harvard-affiliated](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/files/Education%20and%20Teaching%20Policies/Google%20Harvard%20account%20setup.pdf) **Google account** to save your changes in StoryMap.js.
2. You'll also need a **GitHub account.** Instead of signing up on the general site, make sure to get the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) using your Harvard email. This will give you lots great benefits, like more storage space and the ability to have private repositories.
3. You'll also need to download [**Zoomify Free**](http://www.zoomify.com/free.htm) and [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/).

### Making the StoryMaps

I've made two videos that introduce you to StoryMap.js â€“ one about the utility more generally, and one that focuses on how to create a StoryMap that uses a historical map.

If you don't want to watch a video, you can find an excellent written tutorial on how to host your tiled images on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/blob/master/GITHUB_HOSTING/GITHUB_HOSTING.md).
