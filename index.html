        <h1> Indian Indigo, From Household Production to Capitalist Enterprise: The Evolution of a Colonial Commodity </h1>
          <h2> Bengali indigo came to dominate the 19th-century marketplace as the result of active planning by British colonial forces. Through their intervention, indigo was transformed from a regional product into a global commodity. </h2>

          <i> 'Composite: Map of India' by famed British cartographer Aaron Arrowsmith played a crucial role in Britain's colonial governmence in India.
            The map was comissioned by Mark Wood, a colonel of the British army in India and surveyor general and depicts the British controlled areas at the turn of the century.
            In its production, Arrowsmith relied heavily upon "route surveys" carried out by the army.
            As such, it speaks to the military geneology of Britain's colonial presence and – as part of a series of maps produced between 19779 and 1816 – functions as an important marker of colonial expansion.
            The map is lisceneced under a Creative Commons Liscence and thus may be reproduced or transmittted, but not for commerical use.

          In roughly five days worth of browsing, I downloaded approximately 17410 mb of data. The top 5 sites I trafficked were: 43% www.researchgate.com, 24% mail.google.com, 5% aax-us-east.amazon.adsystem.com, 5% canvas and 24% others. Notably, Storymap is not among my top 5 sites. Truthfully, I did not always use Firefox when working on my Storymap; however, I certainly had the impression that I had used Firefox for Storymap more than anything else. Why then was it absent from the results? As I dug deeper into Carboanalyser’s documentation, I realized that the top 5 sites trafficked correlate not to usage traffic, but to data traffic. Thus, while I may have used Storymap far more than I used www.researchgate.com, www.researchgate.com had a much larger data footprint.

          Consequently, my results speak to the environmental impact of remote academic research. Often, scholars and students will utilize online resources in order to ‘limit’ their impact; reading texts online appears more environmentally friendly than printing out 100s of pages or buying a book. While such an assumption may be true, it elides the carbon-footprint of internet usage and, in particular, the large amount of data required to download texts – such as research articles – from the internet. It is also important to consider the impact of the machines we use to do such remote research. In today’s higher-education climate, it is essential to have a functioning laptop; however, the production of laptops is both environmentally deleterious and harmful to humans. Laptops require rare, nonrenewable earth materials whose extraction process produces toxic residue. Moreover, their production and transportation necessitate large amounts of CO2. As our methods of scholarship increasingly more digital – we must ask ourselves, are they truly sustainable? And, if not, how can we continue producing scholarly work in a productive, but also environmentally, friendly manner?

                    It is generally acknowledged that "faithful reproductions of two-dimensional public domain works of art are public domain".
                    This photographic reproduction is therefore also considered to be in the public domain in the United States given that the original is in the public domain it its country of origin.
